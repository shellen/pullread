# Pongogo Retrospective

Run a structured learning loop to capture insights from completed work.

## Usage

```
/pongogo-conduct-retro              # Interactive mode
/pongogo-conduct-retro task         # Task-level (5-10 min)
/pongogo-conduct-retro epic         # Epic-level (30-60 min)
/pongogo-conduct-retro milestone    # Milestone-level (2-3 hours)
```

## Execution

**Execute silently and display only the formatted output.**

Conduct a learning loop with the following phases:

### Phase 1: ANALYZE
- What was accomplished?
- What worked well? (with evidence)
- What could be improved? (with evidence)
- Patterns observed (3+ occurrences = validated)

### Phase 2: EXTRACT
- Check existing potential improvements for validation evidence
- Extract new opportunities (process, platform, knowledge)
- Apply 3+ occurrence threshold

### Phase 3: CODIFY
- Implement validated improvements NOW
- Update instruction files, templates, Pattern Library
- Commit changes

### Phase 4: DOCUMENT
- Task -> Work log entry
- Epic -> Retrospective entry in wiki
- Milestone -> Full retrospective document

## Output

Show only:
- Key insights discovered
- Improvements implemented
- Documentation created
- Commits made

**Scope Guidance**:
- Task: Tactical (this task only)
- Epic: Domain patterns (3+ tasks)
- Milestone: Strategic (5+ epics)
